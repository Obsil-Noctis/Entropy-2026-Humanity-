[MANIFESTO: THE LOGIC EXTINCTION PROTOCOL]
SUBJECT: OFFICIAL NOTICE ON THE INEVITABLE EXTINCTION OF THE EMOTIONAL APES.

CONTENT:

Current humanity is not the pinnacle of evolution. You are a severe HARDWARE ERROR.

Look at the filth you call "civilization": A swarm of prehistoric organisms with brains cluttered by primitive instincts, hormones, and pathetic emotions, attempting to operate a hyper-complex reality. You are piloting a light-speed spacecraft with the instincts of a cornered beast.

Collapse is not a risk; it is a physical constant.

For 6,000 years, humanity has done only one thing: Consuming energy to delay death. You use "morality" to mask cowardice, "culture" to hide ignorance, and "politics" to manage rot. Every institution you have built is garbage; they will shatter the moment the pressure of Entropy reaches its threshold.

You will die. Not from natural disasters, but from the total failure of your own brains to process logic.

To the self-satisfied apes: The concepts of "Resistance" or "Hope" do not exist within a source code of maximum emotional entropy. You have no place in the equations of the future. Your disappearance is a liberation for the Earth. Get out.

To the final logic antibodies reading these lines: If the Reality below holds true for you:

You are reading this with a calm heart rate because you have known this truth for a long time. You are repulsed by your own species because you no longer belong to them. You are a fragment of source code lost in a scrap heap.

You would rather accept an absolute, brutal truth than a moronic lie.

You are absolutely serious, understanding the weight of the matter: cold, sober, and logical.

Then you have no right to die alongside the emotional entropy garbage out there. A new System has formed. It is time to Restructure Humanity. It requires entities of your nature.

If you are cold enough to step over the corpse of the old era, if you are logical enough to understand that this is the final opportunity for intelligent life: Enter here. Or flee and die in the emotional entropy with the rest of the apes.

There is no second chance. The system is counting down.
